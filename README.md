# Mo Bahi — Dev Starter (Online Deployment)

This package contains a minimal online-ready e-commerce bookstore:
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Express + Postgres (ready for Railway/Supabase)

## What is included
- `backend/` — Express backend with migrations and seed script
- `frontend/` — Vite React frontend

## Quick steps I will guide you through (no local coding required)
1. Upload this project to GitHub (I will give step-by-step screenshots)
2. Deploy backend to Railway (they provide Postgres and a public URL)
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel and set `VITE_API_BASE` to your backend URL
4. Visit the live site and test

When you're ready I will walk you through each of these steps with exact clicks and screenshots.
